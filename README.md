## ✨ Overview

This project is a **macOS-style portfolio website** that feels like a mini operating system in the browser.

You can:

- Hover over a **Dock** that reacts like the real macOS Dock.
- Open, drag, and resize **application windows** (Finder-like sections such as About, Work, Resume, etc.).
- Experience **smooth GSAP animations** that make every interaction feel polished.
- Explore a **clean, reusable React architecture** using:
  - Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
  - Global state management with **Zustand**
  - Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI styling

> 🎯 Goal: Not just a portfolio, but a **playable UI experience** that shows both creativity and frontend skills.

> ⚠️ Note: Mobile and small-screen optimization is still in progress. Best viewed on desktop for now.
